## WASI

### due to hard-coded direct calls into WASI for wasi unstable

wasitests_snapshot1::fd_read
wasitests_snapshot1::poll_oneoff
wasitests_snapshot1::fd_pread
wasitests_snapshot1::fd_close
wasitests_snapshot1::fd_allocate
wasitests_snapshot1::close_preopen_fd
wasitests_snapshot1::envvar

### TODO: resolve the disabled tests below. These are newly disabled tests from the migration:

### due to git clone not preserving symlinks:
wasitests_snapshot1::readlink
wasitests_unstable::readlink

### failing due to `remove_dir_all`. this test is also bad for parallelism
wasitests_snapshot1::create_dir
wasitests_unstable::create_dir

### failing because it closes `stdout` which breaks our testing system
wasitests_unstable::fd_close

### failing because we're operating on stdout which is now overridden.
### TODO: check WasiFile implementation
### Alterative: split test into 2 parts, one printing to stderr, the other printing to stdout to test the real versions
wasitests_unstable::poll_oneoff
